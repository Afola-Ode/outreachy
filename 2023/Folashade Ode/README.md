Hello everyone! I go by the name Folashade, but you can simply call me Fola. I'm from Nigeria, and I'm thrilled to introduce myself as a frontend developer looking to make a difference in the world of open source. After thorough research, I discovered Outreachy, a platform that resonated with my aspirations and I am particularly excited to work on Wagtail's Accessibility features documentation.

I've spent some time learning about the Wagtail CMS ecosystem, and I've come to respect the project's dedication to being user-friendly, flexible, and accessible to all users, no matter what abilities they have or what assistive technologies they use.

When I'm not immersed in front of a screen, I find solace in listening to podcasts, reading a good book or cherishing quality time with my family.

I'm eagerly anticipating the opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to this project's effort on accessibility.
